It's the 4th largest city in the United States with 65.1 million visitors in 2018. New York is the financial capital of U.S.A and one of the most diverse states in the country.

        "\n",
        "This also means that the market is highly competitive. As it is highly developed city so cost of doing business is also one of the highest. Therefore, it is essential to analysis the market and data carefully and throughly. The insights derived from analysis will give good understanding of the business environment which help in strategically targeting the market. This will help in reduction of risk.

        "\n",
        "The truth is that as much as there are many fine restaurants in New York â€“ Asian, Middle Eastern, Latin and American restaurants, you can struggle to find an authentic Japanese restaurant that is only speclize in serving sushi.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Discussion of the Background\n",
        "My client- Sushi Dai, a successful restaurant chain in Japan is looking to expand operation into the U.S. through New York. They want to create a high-end restaurant that serve fresh raw fishes catched from the pacific ocean. To them every customer counts and everyone is a VIP when you dine at their chain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the New York's demography is scattered, my client needs deep insight from available data in other to decide where to establish it's first restaurant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our company is an expert in data analytics and spends a lot of resources on research and provides customers with data insight.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.3 Target Audience\n",
        "My client- Sushi Dai wants to open its business in Manhattan area, so as the Chief Data Officer, I will focus on that borough during my analysis. I will define potential neighborhood based on the number of sushi restaurants which are operating right in each neighborhood. Manhattan has full potential but also is a very challenging district to open a business because of high competition. New sushi restaurant should be open in an area that inadequate neighborhood in this way the restaurant can attract more customers. Therefore, this analysis is necessary to ensure that we have enough customers and that we are not so close to similiar competitors."
